      <h2>Target audience</h2>
     <p>The target audience for a chamber of commerce includes business owners, startups, government agencies, professionals, and community leaders. 
        There is a place in Duvall for anyone in the community from someone looking for something at an autopart store to looking for some place to eat.  There is a nice bar and grill and icecream shop with two nice gerocry stores. If it gets too hot outside in the summer time you can even cool down in the river.</p>
